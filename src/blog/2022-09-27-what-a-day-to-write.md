[](https://obsproject.com/)So what did it take to start a Youtube channel and finish my first series? A lot of learning and a lot of work over 4 months producing 5 videos in the process. 

While I have a decent background in coding from 7 years of hobbyist web development I was brand new to video editing when I started and had to figure out my recording setup, editing software, and a host of other issues that came up during the process. 

The first challenge I hit was figuring out my recording setup, determining whether or not to include my face or just my voice alongside a screen capture. I was able to use my phone to stream to my laptop using the Iriun webcam but wasn't pleased with the result or the lighting I was able to setup so I decided to go with screen capture with voice over instead. The best tool I was able to find was Open Broadcast Studio (<https://obsproject.com/>) which enable me to combine all my recording elements in one place. Next was figuring out how to record decent audio - continue writing after break.
